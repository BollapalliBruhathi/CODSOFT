Task1-TO-DO-LIST

This is a simple to-do list application implemented in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

There is a set of tasks that awaits us every new day. Some of them might be interesting, and some can be tedious. However, the significance of completing these tasks is unquestionable, specifically in case they build on a regular basis.

There might be times when many of us struggle to keep a record of what we require. Perhaps some of us are in the habit of using a handwritten to-do list to remind ourselves of the pending things and their deadlines. However, handwritten notes have a higher chance of getting lost or forgotten. Since we are the Python coders, it makes sense to build a To-do list manager application using Tkinter.

Features:

Add tasks: Enter a task in the text entry field and click "Add task" to add it to the list

Update tasks: Select a task from the list, enter the updated task in the text entry field, and click "Update task" to update it.

Track tasks: Keep track of your to-do list items in a scrollable list

Usage:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/example/to-do-list-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd to-do-list-app

Run the application:
python todo_app.py

git clone https://github.com/your_username/password-generator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd password-generator

Usage:

python password_generator.py

Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.
The generated password will be displayed on the screen.

Example:

Enter the desired length of the password: 12
Generated Password: q@rJ8*4LPXt2




TASK-4 (ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS)

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the game rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

 Features:

- User-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
- Tracks the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
- Allows the user to play again after each round.

 Usage:
 
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file from this repository.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `rock_paper_scissors.py` is located.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
python rock_paper_scissors.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:
- Choose rock, paper, or scissors.
- See the result (win, lose, or tie).
- Keep track of the scores.
- Decide whether to play again.

 Example:
 
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Choose rock, paper, or scissors: rock

You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!

Your score: 1
Computer's score: 0

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): yes
Choose rock, paper, or scissors: paper
