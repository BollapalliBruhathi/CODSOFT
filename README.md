Task1 (TO-DO-LIST)

There is a set of tasks that awaits us every new day. Some of them might be interesting, and some can be tedious. However, the significance of completing these tasks is unquestionable, specifically in case they build on a regular basis.

There might be times when many of us struggle to keep a record of what we require. Perhaps some of us are in the habit of using a handwritten to-do list to remind ourselves of the pending things and their deadlines. However, handwritten notes have a higher chance of getting lost or forgotten. Since we are the Python coders, it makes sense to build a To-do list manager application using Tkinter.

simple To-Do list manager GUI application using the Tkinter library in the Python programming language.

Building a To-Do list application using Tkinter
The procedure of building a To-Do list management application using Tkinter is divided into several steps. These steps are shown below:

Step 1: First, we will import all the modules required to build the project. Step 2: We will then define some functions necessary to execute the application. Step 3: We will then create a main window for the application. Step 4: We will then add a database to the application to store the data. Step 5: We will add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.

Task 2 (calculator)

We developed a basic Calculator application using Tkinter and input field, buttons and for the calculation purpose we will use logic in our code defined in functions, like if you want to add two numbers then behind this there must be a logic for addition purpose, similarly for substraction, multiplication, etc, we have created functions whose task is to perform these operations.

There are a variety of functions in Tkinter with the help of them it becomes easy and convenient to make a simple calculator just with this little code. Apart from the Tkinter widgets, we have defined the following functions in our code:

btn_click() Function: This function handles the button click on various numeric buttons to add them to the operation.

bt_clear() Function: This function is used to handle the clear operation to clean the previous input in the Calculator application.

bt_equal() Function: This function is used to handle the equal button to execute the operation and show the result.

Task 3 (Password generator)

Creating a password generator using Python and the Tkinter library for a simple graphical user interface (GUI) is a great project
We import the Tkinter library and other necessary modules.

We define a function generate_password that generates a random password based on the desired length and populates it in the entry field.
We create the main Tkinter window (root) and set its title.

We create labels, entry fields, and a button for inputting the password length and generating the password.

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it calls the generate_password function.
The generated password is displayed in the entry field for passwords.
