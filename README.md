Task1 (TO-DO-LIST)

This is a simple to-do list application implemented in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

There is a set of tasks that awaits us every new day. Some of them might be interesting, and some can be tedious. However, the significance of completing these tasks is unquestionable, specifically in case they build on a regular basis.

There might be times when many of us struggle to keep a record of what we require. Perhaps some of us are in the habit of using a handwritten to-do list to remind ourselves of the pending things and their deadlines. However, handwritten notes have a higher chance of getting lost or forgotten. Since we are the Python coders, it makes sense to build a To-do list manager application using Tkinter.

Features:

Add tasks: Enter a task in the text entry field and click "Add task" to add it to the list.

Update tasks: Select a task from the list, enter the updated task in the text entry field, and click "Update task" to update it.

Track tasks: Keep track of your to-do list items in a scrollable list

Usage:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/example/to-do-list-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd to-do-list-app

Run the application:
python todo_app.py
