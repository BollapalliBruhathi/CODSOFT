Task1-TO-DO-LIST

This is a simple to-do list application implemented in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

There is a set of tasks that awaits us every new day. Some of them might be interesting, and some can be tedious. However, the significance of completing these tasks is unquestionable, specifically in case they build on a regular basis.

There might be times when many of us struggle to keep a record of what we require. Perhaps some of us are in the habit of using a handwritten to-do list to remind ourselves of the pending things and their deadlines. However, handwritten notes have a higher chance of getting lost or forgotten. Since we are the Python coders, it makes sense to build a To-do list manager application using Tkinter.

Features:

Add tasks: Enter a task in the text entry field and click "Add task" to add it to the list

Update tasks: Select a task from the list, enter the updated task in the text entry field, and click "Update task" to update it.

Track tasks: Keep track of your to-do list items in a scrollable list

Usage:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/example/to-do-list-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd to-do-list-app

Run the application:
python todo_app.py





Task2-CALCULATOR

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Features

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
Displays an error message for division by zero.

 Usage
1. Run the `calculator.py` script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   Enter the desired arithmetic operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
   Input the first number.
   Input the second number.
3. The program will output the result of the operation.




TASK-3 PASSWORD GENERATOR


Description
This is a simple password generator application implemented in Python. It allows users to specify the desired length and complexity of the password and generates a strong, random password accordingly.

Features:

User input to specify the length of the password.
Generation of passwords using a combination of random characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation).
Display of the generated password on the screen.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/password-generator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd password-generator

Usage:

python password_generator.py

Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.
The generated password will be displayed on the screen.

Example:

Enter the desired length of the password: 12
Generated Password: q@rJ8*4LPXt2

Dependencies:

This project requires Python 3.x. No additional libraries are needed.
